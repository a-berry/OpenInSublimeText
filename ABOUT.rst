OpenInSublimeText.app Notes
===========================

The below instructions do not install exactly as described, it actually takes some fiddling with AppleScript and stuff. Follow these steps with a large grain of Na.

July 1, 2011: Added a OIST2.app file (by saving the Apple Script here as a .app) that you should be able to just drag to the OSX Finder windows button area. Then just click the script app button and the currently selected file or window will be opened in Sublime Text 2 (assuming you installed THAT beforehand, of course). 


About OpenInSublimeText
-----------------------

OpenInSublimeText is a complete rip from Henrik Nyh's
`Open in Textmate <http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-in-textmate-from-leopard-finder>`_
gadget:


Thanks to Henrik for putting that handy little gadget together!

I wanted the same functionality in the OS X Finder for Sublime Text 2
and lightly hacked Nyh's stuff to point at Sublime Text. Then, hacked
a little icon together to make it all nice.


Installing the OpenInSublimeText gadget
---------------------------------------
Here's how I'd do it:

#. Make a ``scripts`` folder in your Applications folder
#. Download a copy (or git clone) of OpenInSublimeText.app
   and drop it in that scripts folder.
#. Drop the ``OpenInSublimeText`` app on the toolbar

Well, that's about it. You're ready to go!

If you have questions you can send me a note.

  Thanks, dude!

Sublime Text 2

If you are looking for a configurable, quick and dirty text editor
for OS X, give `Sublime Text 2 <http://www.sublimetext.com/2>`_ a go.
Totally awesome!
